better-initramfs
================

Piotr Karbowski <jabberuser@gmail.com>

This project *may* contain some code from initramfs projects that can be found on github, gentoo-wiki.com and jootamam.net.

Goal
====
The goal is to make an easy to use initramfs with support for dmcrypted rootfs, rootfs over LVM array and the remote rescue shell (sshd). 

Status
======
dmcrypt support - works.
lvm rootfs support - works.
dmcrypt rootfs over lvm - should work, not tested.
lvm rootfs over dmcrypt - same as above.
rescue shell (drop to busybox sh before mount rootfs) - works
remote rescue shell - not yet.

Usage
=====
This docs is based on Funtoo/Gentoo GNU/Linux so package names etc. can be different than in your distro.

build with static use flag:
sys-apps/busybox
sys-fs/cryptsetup
sys-fs/lvm2

go to initramfs_root/bin dir and:
cp -v /bin/busybox busybox
cp -v /sbin/cryptsetup cryptsetup
cp -v /sbin/lvm.static lvm
ln -s busybox sh
ln -s busybox bb

Now, copy one of config.example to 'config' and edit it (config file is optimal). Each env like root, enc_root, lvm etc can be set with a kernel boot parameter. Available kernel boot parameters:
rescueshell		(drop to busybox sh just before mount rootfs to /newroot)
lvm=true		(or =false. Enable getting up LVM volumes if any, set true if you have rootfs on LVM.)
dmcrypt_rootfs=true	(or =false. Enable cryptsetup luksOpen on selected enc_root, set true if you have encrypted rootfs.)
enc_root=device		(for example =/dev/sda2 if sda2 is your encrypted rootfs. This env is ignored if dmcrypt_rootfs isn't set to true.)
root=device		(for example =/dev/mapper/rootfs if you have dmcrypted rootfs, =/dev/mapper/vg-rootfs or similar if lvm or just =/dev/sdXX if you don't have lvm based or dmcrypted rootfs.)

Now, go up one level outside the initramfs_root dir (cd ..) and execute 'sh testbindir.sh', you should get something like:
[ OK ] busybox found.
[ OK ] lvm found.
[ OK ] cryptsetup found.
[ OK ] bb is symlink to busybox.
[ OK ] sh is symlink to busybox.

Now just pack your initramfs image by 'sh make_initramfs.sh' and you should have a shiny brand-new initramfs.cpio.gz ready for use.

Example
=======
Few example on grub(1) config, all new set by kernel boot parametr.

Dmcrypted rootfs:
title Funtoo bzImage-2.6.32-gentoo-r5
kernel /bzImage-2.6.32-gentoo-r5 root=/dev/mapper/rootfs enc_root=/dev/sda2 dmcrypt_rootfs=true
initrd /initramfs.cpio.gz

LVM based rootfs:
title Funtoo bzImage-2.6.32-gentoo-r5
kernel /bzImage-2.6.32-gentoo-r5 root=/dev/mapper/main-rootfs lvm=true
initrd /initramfs.cpio.gz

LVM based rootfs, rescueshell:
title Funtoo bzImage-2.6.32-gentoo-r5
kernel /bzImage-2.6.32-gentoo-r5 root=/dev/mapper/main-rootfs lvm=true rescueshell
initrd /initramfs.cpio.gz
