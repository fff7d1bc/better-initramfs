devel branch:
	- Support --non-zero-ok in run function.
	- Make DHCP fallback into link local on failed attempt to get lease (#58),
	- Use install instead of cp to make sure the static binaries are
	  executable, fixes potential kernel panic on /init start failure.
	- Replace chroot with bwrap (bubblewrap) - full support for building as
	  unprivileged user! But also requires 'bwrap' to be part of $PATH on the
	  host build system.
	- Removal or mknod calls, might require manual mknod in sourceroot/dev in
	  case of embeddeding initramfs into kernel image.
	- Version bumps since last release:
		sysroot Alpine Linux 3.11.5 -> 3.17.2
		busybox 1.31.1 -> 1.36.0
		lvm2 2.02.186 -> 2.02.188
		dropbear 2019.78 -> 2022.83
		libuuid (util-linux ) 2.35.1 -> 2.37
		libblkid (util-linux ) 2.35.1 -> 2.37
		popt 1.16 -> 1.18
		libgpg-error 1.37 -> 1.42
		libgcrypt 1.8.5 -> 1.8.8

v0.10.0:
	- Provide /run/cryptsetup within initramfs. Fixes cryptsetup with luks2 header.
	- rootflags= support added (unqueued)
	- Typo fix in 00_profile.sh (André Erdmann)
	- The cryptsetup path is no longer hardcoded (André Erdmann)
	- Number of changes around `eval` usage to not crash if ever findfs return
	  white character, eval no longer running in subshells. (André Erdmann)
	- Fixes around parsing cmdline options, no longer export variables with
	  dot in its name (André Erdmann)
	- cttyhack support (André Erdmann)
	- Support for binit_net_addr=dhcp. Requested by Mathieu Garstecki in
	  issue #46
	- use rootdelay before trying to activate dmcrypt/lvm/etc.
	- simplify process_commandline_options() by dropping get_opt() all
	  together
	- uswsusp support removed.
	  I had mixed luck with this one, and found that the in-kernel swsusp just
	  works, and after resume system is snappier. I don't think anyone used
	  uswsusp, if there's any user, ping me, so I can make suspend-1.0 to be
	  buildable with musl toolchain and restore the feature.
	- All the dependencies are re-hosted under bitbucket account.
	- cryptsetup and libgcrypt is now always built with O3 instead of Os.

	  has not been visable. (Reported by Coornaert David)

	- Bcache bugfix: Use /proc/partitions instead of /sys/block/*.
	  The latter one does not lists partitons on top level.

	- softraid: don't poke kernel to auto detect v0.9 arrays.
	- Version bumps:

	- Don't wait remaining time for sshd if we send resume-boot from remote
	  shell (Andrew Glinskiy)
	- Fix misprint (Andrew Glinskiy)
	- Move run early hooks before SetupNetwork to have the abillity to insert
	  any kernel modules because on init hooks we are not have busybox symlinks.
	  Also setup /dev before early hooks that we have a complete minimal
	  environment. And move rootdelay nerly root mount point.(Andrew Glinskiy)
	- Wait for sshd connection only if rescueshell have never occur (Andrew Glinskiy)
	- Add support of profile source priority, it's useful with multiple
	  initrds (Andrew Glinskiy)
	- Show running hooks (Andrew Glinskiy)
	- Lazy umount /dev/pts in case of ssh login inside initramfs.
	- Bcache support, now can boot with rootfs on bcache block device.

v0.8.0.1, 04-08-2013:
	- Pass $PATH env variable to $init.
	- Don't kill sshd until remote-rescueshell.lock is released.

v0.8, 03-08-2013:
	- get_sshd_keys target added to Makefile.
	- bootstrap-all target added to Makefile.
	- sshd_interface, sshd_ipv4 and sshd_ipv4_gateway variables were changed
	into binit_net_if, binit_net_addr and binit_net_gw.
	- SetupNetwork() function now take care of setting network up.
	- Hooks support, now you can include own code in init, early,
	pre_newroot_mount and pre_switch_root phases.
	- ssh client included (dbclinet).
	- relaxed_mknod() function, 'prepare' make target will try to create basic
	device nodes, its needed when you include initramfs into kernel image,
	otherwise boot process may fail with missing /dev/console message. (kernel
	bug or feature?)
	- A lot of small changes, fixes, adjustments.
